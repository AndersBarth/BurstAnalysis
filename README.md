# BurstAnalysis
Code to simulate time traces and analyse burst search algorithms

In this github 3 folders are created:

1: Simulation of time traces
2: Analysis of burst search algorithms
3: Plotting the analysis results

Keep in mind that the plots require saved data created with the analysis code. One must save the data created for the varying algorithms of interest to create plots.
